# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Exploring various Machine Learning algorithms on the given Dataset

<p>This is a classification problem and the goal is to predict if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on the observations/features.</p> 

<p>Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29 OR 
 https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data#data.csv </p> 
 
<p>The dataset contains 30 Features with diagnosis as the target field.</p>
<br/> 
<p> We follow simple steps to solve the problem: </p>
 
 **Step 1: Analyse the data** &nbsp;
 a) The dataset set good number of examples for both malignant (1) and benign (0) cases
